## Index

| [WB Fleet Integration](wb-fleet-integration/README.md) | Draft | Fleet-safe CodeGrapher behavior for WB-managed repositories and worktrees. |
| [SpecScore Source Traceability](specscore-source-traceability/README.md) | Implementing | Connect accepted SpecScore source directives to canonical Feature, REQ, AC, and scenario nodes. |
